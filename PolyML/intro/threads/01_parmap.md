# ChatGPT Explanation of Example 1

## Definitons

Here are the terms, in plain words.

ParMap: A module that groups this code.
parMap: The main func. It runs work in threads.

func: A named block that takes input and returns output.
list: An ordered chain of items.
array: A fixed block of slots by index.
index: A number that picks a slot.
slot: One cell in the array.

thread: A unit of work that can run with others.
spawn: Start a new thread.
thread pool: A set of threads kept and reused.

mutex: A lock so one thread enters at once.
lock: Take the mutex. Others must wait.
unlock: Let go of the mutex.
guard: Protect data with a lock.
shared state: Data that threads touch in common.

cond var: A wait/notify object for threads.
wait: Sleep on a cond var until a signal.
broadcast: Wake all threads that wait on the cond var.

ref: A box you can set and read.
remaining: A count of work not yet done.
decrement: Subtract one from a count.

option type: A value that is SOME or NONE.
SOME: Marks a present value.
NONE: Marks no value.
valOf: Get the value from SOME. It fails on NONE.

helper: A small func used by a big func.
map: Apply one func to each item in a list.
parallel: Do many map steps at the same time.
order of results: Keep results in the input order.
demo: A short run that shows how to use it.
use case: One real task the code can solve.
runtime: Time the code needs to run.
scale: How code acts as size grows.

---

In PolyML (i.e. in Standard ML / ML syntax), `=>` is used in pattern‐matching clauses, such as in `fn` (anonymous function) definitions or `case` expressions. ([smlhelp.github.io](https://smlhelp.github.io/book/docs/start/syntax/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "SML Syntax Cheatsheet"))

Concretely:

- In `fn pattern => expr`, it defines a function whose input is matched by `pattern` and yields `expr`.

- In `case e of pattern1 => expr1 | pattern2 => expr2 | …`, it matches `e` against patterns and evaluates the corresponding expression after `=>`.

So `=>` separates a _pattern_ (on the left) from the _result expression_ (on the right) in pattern matching.

If you show me the context where you saw `=>` in PolyML code, I can explain exactly what it means there.

## Explanation

Here is what the code does.

It defines a `ParMap` structure.
It has one main func, `parMap`.

`parMap` takes a func `f` and list `xs`.
It runs `f` on each item in threads.
It keeps the same order of results.

Setup steps inside `parMap`:

- Get `n`, the list length.

- Make a mutex `m`.

- Make a cond var `cv`.

- Make an array `out` of `NONE`.

- Make a ref `remaining = n`.

The helper `put (i, y)` does this:

- Lock the mutex.

- Store `SOME y` at index `i`.

- Decrement `remaining` by one.

- If none remain, broadcast on `cv`.

- Unlock the mutex.

One part is elided by `...`.
That part should spawn the threads.
Each thread runs `f x` for one item.
Then each thread calls `put (i, y)`.

After spawn, the main thread waits:

- Lock the mutex.

- While work remains, wait on `cv`.

- Unlock the mutex.

Then it builds the result list.
It reads each slot from `out`.
It uses `valOf` to extract each value.
This gives results in the input order.

The demo shows a use case:

- Build `input = [1..8]`.

- Map with `x*x` in parallel.

- Print the eight square numbers.

Key points to note:

- The mutex guards shared state.

- The cond var lets the main wait.

- It spawns `n` threads at once.

- Huge lists may harm run time.

- A pool could help with scale.
